# The Error Type

The error type in Go is implemented as the following interface:

```go
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
```

So basically, an error is anything that implements the Error() method, which returns an error message as a string. It’s that simple!

# Conclusion

That’s a wrap! In summary, here’s the gist of what was covered here:

    Errors in Go are just lightweight pieces of data that implement the Error interface
    Predefined errors will improve signaling, allowing us to check which error occurred
    Wrap errors to add enough context to trace through function calls (similar to a stack trace)

I hope you found this guide to effective error handling useful. If you’d like to learn more, I’ve attached some related articles I found interesting during my own journey to robust error handling in Go.
